# Level 2 Task 9 -Towards defensive programming II

## Task 1

Follow these steps:

● Open the Java file Errors.java.

● Attempt to compile the program. You’ll notice the compilation will fail due to some errors. Fix all the compilation errors and compile the program again. Every time you fix an error, add a comment to the line you fixed and indicate which of the three types of errors it was.

● Now run the program. Once again, you’ll encounter some errors (this time, runtime errors). Fix these errors and run the program once again to see if it works.

● Now run the program and notice the output. You’ll notice that there are some logical errors in the code. Fix these errors and run the program once again to see if it now correctly displays what it should.

## Task 2

● Follow the instructions above on how to debug a program using Eclipse.

● Create a password authenticator that asks a user to create a password. The program will ask them to type the password the first time and then ask them to type it in again to confirm.

● The password is deemed unusable if it does not contain a number or the two inputs don’t match.

● Every password entered by the user should be written to a text file.

● Print out whether the password has been created or not. If it has not been created, specify what the user needs to fix and ask the user to try again.

● Use defensive programming to write this program in a manner that is robust and handles unexpected events and user inputs.
